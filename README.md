## ✔️ Challenge 2 — 'reverseWord'
Write a method **'reverseWord'** that takes a 'String word' as a parameter.  
The method should **return a new String with the characters reversed**.

**Example:**  
'reverseWord("hello")' → '"olleh"'

---

## ✔️ Challenge 3 — 'capitalizeString'
Write a method **'capitalizeString'** that takes a 'String sentence' as a parameter.  
The method should **return a new String in which the first letter of every word is capitalized**, leaving the rest of the letters unchanged.

**Example:**  
'capitalizeString("the quick brown fox")' → '"The Quick Brown Fox"'

## ✔️ Challenge 4 — 'detectPalindrome'
Write a method **'detectPalindrome'** that takes a 'String word' as a parameter.  
The method should **return 'true' if the word reads the same forward and backward** (ignoring case), and **'false' otherwise**.

**Example:**  
- 'detectPalindrome("Racecar")' → 'true'  
- 'detectPalindrome("Java")' → 'false'

## ✔️ Challenge 5 — 'firstUniqueChar'
Write a method **'firstUniqueChar'** that takes a 'String word' and returns the **first character that appears exactly once** in that String.  
If no such character exists, return a space '' '' (or another sentinel value of your choice).

**Examples:**  
- 'firstUniqueChar("swiss")' → ''w''  
- 'firstUniqueChar("aabbcc")' → '' ''
